This is a basic arithmetic calculator created with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

This program is not 100% bug-free. If any bugs are found please let me know!

Future Implemenations:

Add a button to change the sign of a number
Fix bug where clicking equals multiple times does not update result as it should. (Ex. does not increment if you added something)
